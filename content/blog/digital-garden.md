It seems like the concept of a 'Digital Garden' has been increasingly popular lately. People like [Joel Hook](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) dive into some details of what they think a digital garden is and the role it plays in their lives.

For me, this will be a place to evolve my ideas over time. The end goal isn't perfection. I plan on approaching this in a similar way that I approach code. Produce something, keeping it simple at first, continue learning, and iterate on the ideas over time.

Just like a dirt garden, a digital garden will take time and patience. But with the proper amount of care it can yield great things.

Writing doesn't come easy to me. I am not a storyteller by any means. But this doesn't mean I can't learn to express my ideas and write well. Just like any skill the best way to get better is practice.

There are a few things that have recently inspired me to start producing content instead of just consuming it. Huge thanks to my coworker [Mark Chandler](https://twitter.com/grow_love) who is also going through a similar journey and recently got me involved in the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) open source project. At the same time, I am trying to surround myself with other content creators and people I aspire to be like, and have made connections to some of those people in the Party Corgi Discord. I am also inspired by the 'learn in public' mindset [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) has made so popular.

I plan on writing about:

- Chakra and my involvement in open source
- React, JavaScript, and other front end technologies
- Django and Python
- the developer community, meetups, and organizing a conference
- mentoring devs
- weightlifting
- whatever else that comes to mind

My goal is to produce something regularly. I don't want the desire for perfection to lead to inaction. Hopefully I can help others along the way.
